# üß± **Windows Firewall Configuration & Port Filtering**

### Overview

This project demonstrates practical firewall management on **Windows 10** using **Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security**.
It focuses on how administrators can control network traffic by **creating, testing, and managing rules** that block or allow communication through specific ports.

By implementing and testing a block rule on **port 23 (Telnet)**, this project highlights the critical role of firewall policies in **network defense and secure system configuration**.

---

## üéØ **Objectives**

* Understand the **function and structure** of Windows Firewall.
* Learn to **create, apply, and test** firewall rules.
* Gain hands-on experience in **blocking and verifying traffic** on selected ports.
* Explore **inbound/outbound rules** and how they affect connectivity.
* Build a foundational skill set for **network traffic filtering** and **endpoint protection**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Tools & Environment**

| Component                | Details                                                  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Operating System**     | Windows 10                                               |
| **Firewall Utility**     | Windows Defender Firewall (Advanced Security)            |
| **Protocol**             | TCP                                                      |
| **Port Tested**          | 23 (Telnet ‚Äì insecure protocol)                          |
| **Verification Command** | `Test-NetConnection -ComputerName localhost -Port 23`    |
| **Result**               | `TcpTestSucceeded : False` ‚Üí ‚úÖ Port Blocked Successfully |

## üß© **Step-by-Step Process**

### üß± Step 1 ‚Äî Open Firewall Settings

Opened the **Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security** panel using:

```
control firewall.cpl
```

‚Üí Clicked **Advanced Settings** to access inbound and outbound rule management.

### üîç Step 2 ‚Äî Review Existing Rules

Examined the existing **Inbound Rules** to understand how applications like Microsoft Teams, Windows services, and other system components communicate over the network.

---

### üö´ Step 3 ‚Äî Create a Custom Block Rule

Created a new **Inbound Rule** to **block TCP traffic on port 23**, which is typically used by the unencrypted **Telnet protocol**.

Steps:

1. Click **New Rule ‚Üí Port ‚Üí TCP**
2. Specify **Port 23**
3. Select **Block the Connection**
4. Apply to all profiles (Domain, Private, Public)
5. Name it **Block Telnet Port 23**

‚úÖ This rule ensures no incoming Telnet requests are allowed on the host.


---

### üß™ Step 4 ‚Äî Verify Firewall Block

Used **PowerShell** to verify that the firewall successfully blocked port 23 connections.

Command:

```powershell
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName localhost -Port 23
```

Output:

```
WARNING: TCP connect to (::1 : 23) failed
TcpTestSucceeded : False
```

This confirms the connection attempt was blocked by the firewall.


---

### üßπ Step 5 ‚Äî Cleanup

Removed the test rule to restore normal operation:

* Opened **Inbound Rules**
* Located **Block Telnet Port 23**
* Right-clicked ‚Üí **Delete**

This ensures system connectivity is back to default while retaining security learning records.

## üìä **Summary of Actions**

| Step | Action                          | Outcome                                       |
| ---- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Accessed Firewall settings      | Successfully launched advanced firewall panel |
| 2    | Reviewed existing inbound rules | Understood allowed and blocked services       |
| 3    | Created Port 23 block rule      | Restricted Telnet connections                 |
| 4    | Verified using PowerShell       | Confirmed the rule worked                     |
| 5    | Deleted test rule               | Restored firewall to default configuration    |

## üîê **Key Learnings**

* **Inbound vs Outbound Rules:**
  Inbound controls traffic *coming into* your PC; outbound controls *leaving* traffic.
* **Blocking Insecure Protocols:**
  Telnet (port 23) sends data in plain text ‚Äî blocking it prevents credential theft.
* **Testing Rules:**
  Always verify firewall rules with command-line tools like `Test-NetConnection`.
* **Firewall Importance:**
  Acts as a first line of defense, filtering malicious or unauthorized network packets.
